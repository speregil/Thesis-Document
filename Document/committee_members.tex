%%%%%  Formatting commands (you can ignore these)  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% format this chapter title
\newcommand\CMstyle[1]{\pdfbookmark[0]{#1}{thesiscommittee}\bfseries\Large\lsstyle \MakeUppercase{#1}}

\newcommand\CMsubstyle[1]{\pdfbookmark[1]{#1}{#1}\flushright\normalfont\scshape\large\lsstyle #1}

%   \lsstyle produces additional letter separation (appropriate for capitalized display text),
% 	when \usepackage{microtype} has been given in the preamble. 
% 	If microtype has not been loaded, mitthesis.cls will ignore this command.
% 	The extra space added between letters is 100/1000 em (adjustable, see microtype documentation).
