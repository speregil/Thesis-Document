By consequence, dissecting and analyzing game engines performances would help to better understand how to move to these new directions, which is so far missing in the literature. In this paper, we fill this gap by analyzing and evaluating one of the most popular game engine, namely Unity3D. First, we dissected the Unity3D architecture and modules. A benchmark was then used to evaluate the CPU and GPU performances of the different modules constituting Unity3D, for five representative games.},

The research presented here proceeds from the alternative assumption: Novice behavior is inherently sensible, and the computer system can be made to adapt to it. Specifically, a measurably easy-to-use interface was built to accommodate the actual behavior of novice users. Novices attempted an electronic mail task using a command-line interface containing no help, no menus, no documentation, and no instruction. A hidden operator intercepted commands when necessary, creating the illusion of an interactive session. The software was repeatedly revised to recognize users' new commands; in essence, the interface was derived from user behavior. This procedure was used on 67 subjects. The first version of the software could recognize only 7 percent of all the subjects' spontaneously generated commands; the final version could recognize 76 percent of these commands. This experience contradicts the idea that user input is irrelevant to the design of command languages. Through careful observation and analysis of user behavior, a mail interface unusable by novices evolved into one that let novices do useful work within minutes.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted traditional face-to-face teaching worldwide and forced education institutions to adopt new, online teaching formats to enable students to continue with their studies. This research focuses on students’ perceptions of three teaching different modalities: face-to-face (F2F), Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) and Smart Classroom (SC), which were implemented in response to the restrictions enforced to combat the spread of COVID-19. A qualitative study based on two user experience techniques, Pocket Bipolar Laddering and Emotional Appraisal, was carried out on a group of second-year ICT engineering university students at La Salle Campus Barcelona. The former technique consists in identifying a maximum of three positive and three negative salient items, while the latter is intended to rate pairs of opposite feelings. In the SC format, saving time on travel to university was considered an advantage of online learning, while disadvantages included less effective instructor–student interaction, distractions when off-campus and teamwork issues. These shortcomings can be addressed by specific online teaching training to develop a more active form of learning and foment student participation. However, both ERT and SC modalities were considered effective solutions to cope with the social and mobility restrictions imposed during the pandemic.},

	abstract = {Purpose As an institution that has invested in e-learning infrastructure and technology for e-learning delivery, Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak conducted The Digital Educator Series as a means of embracing this educational disruption. In particular, this paper reports on the first three courses held under the Digital Educator Series that aims to equip teachers with practical and effective online teaching to school teachers in Sarawak. While the training is still in effect, preliminary results are shared, and implications for practice and recommendations for further research are considered. Design/methodology/approach Approximately 136 questionnaires containing close-and open-ended items were distributed to the teacher participants of the Digital Educator Series. Close-ended items were designed to gather general information about their perceptions of online teaching and learning. Items were constructed to gather insights on familiarity with online teaching and learning, perceived usefulness of platforms such as Microsoft Teams and Google Classrooms. The open-ended items were designed to gather information on areas of improvement for the courses and professional development needs of teachers for online teaching. Findings The findings revealed very mixed responses in terms of teachers' familiarity with online teaching and learning. Nonetheless, it was encouraging that the majority of teachers felt positively about the impact and usefulness of the courses in the Digital Educator Series and have expressed that would like to learn more about online teaching pedagogy. Teachers reported the greatest familiarity with Google Classroom and were very positive about the applicability the Google Classroom Course (91.2\%) in their own teaching practice. Conversely, all of the participants reported they were unfamiliar with Microsoft Teams. Accordingly, the teachers did not perceive its applicability to be as high as the Google Classroom. The qualitative findings further corroborated this and expressed the need for specific professional development programmes that include pedagogical and technological support. Overall, the teachers are strongly focussed in their professional development in order to improve their online teaching, Research limitations/implications Like other research, this too has its limitations. The sample size in this study was restricted to those who attended the Digital Educator Series training. Hence the results of this study, whilst have been enriching, and to a certain extent are supported by the current literature, the accuracy of the description may be unique to this particular group of individuals, within this particular setting. Additionally, the study only relied on self-reports from both the questionnaire and the semi-structured interviews. This study accepts that self-reports have shortcomings. Not all experiences of the courses would have been readily accessible through the teachers' conscious reflections. This makes it difficult to construct a complete picture of the experience, challenges and identify all salient factors within a particular workshop or training. Practical implications Although the adoption of teaching and learning to online platforms is undoubtedly the way to maintain continuity of learning for students, it has also unveiled glaring inequities in Sarawak. Therefore, continuous and personalised professional development needs to be provided, focussing on pedagogical and technological support. There is a need to embrace these changes as a long-term response that will develop and improve over the next few years. That response should include better infrastructure, policies for quality improvement, accessibility standards and strategic plans for continuous access in the future. This includes advocating for platforms that can fit into the core technology environment and for teachers to adopt an innovative mindset. Originality/value In light of the complex and multifaceted challenge of transitioning to online learning in Sarawak Malaysia, it was evident that the need for innovative solutions to optimize educational endeavours has become accelerated. To ensure that students are well-supported and widening participation and access to education, it is imperative that the education disruption be embraced. This starts with addressing teachers' digital literacy through a professional development programme of online reaching.},

This study aimed at investigating the effect of these innovations on the implementation, acceptance and use of the virtual teaching offer within the framework of the technology acceptance model (TAM).Methods: A total of 218 students and 69 lecturers of a German Medical Faculty completed online questionnaires on the acceptance, satisfaction and usefulness of the forced distance learning (FDL) and teaching (FDT), respectively. An extended version of the TAM was used to assess students’ and lecturers’ acceptance of FDL and FDT. In order to estimate the multivariate dependencies, path analysis was employed using structural equation modeling (SEM).Results: In general, students and lecturers reported to be satisfied with the implementation of the FDL and FDT. Regarding the TAM model, the fit indices suggested an acceptable model fit for both groups. The students’ model revealed that the perceived usefulness had a strong predictive power on the attitude towards using and the perceived ease of use also predicted the attitude. The existing technical infrastructure as well as the general media affinity and pandemic related worries proved to be positively associated with the perceived usefulness while data security worries and organization of online teaching predicted the perceived ease of use in students. The strong positive predictive power of the perceived usefulness for the attitude towards using was also evident in the model for the lecturers and the technical infrastructure predicted the perceived the perceived ease of use in the lecturers.Conclusion: The TAM is a suitable framework to represent the implementation, acceptance and use of the virtual teaching offer during the special pandemic situation at the university. However, personal and structural context factors were important predictors for the perceived usefulness and the perceived ease of use in the student group.},

In the first experiment, we compared optical, stereo- and mono-video, and immersive head mounted displays (HMDs) using a target identification task. It was found that differences in the real world visibility severely affect communication behaviors. The optical see-through case produced the best results with the least extra communication needed. Generally, the more difficult it was to use non-verbal communication cues, the more people resorted to speech cues to compensate. In the second experiment, we compared three different combinations of task and communication spaces using a 2D icon design task with optical see-through HMDs. It was found that the spatial relationship between the task and communication spaces also severely affected communication behaviors. Placing the task space between the subjects produced the most active behaviors in terms of initiatory body languages and utterances with least miscommunications.},

ACAD offers a practical approach to analysing complex learning situations, in a way that can generate knowledge that is reusable in subsequent (re)design work. ACAD has been developed over the last two decades. It has been tested and refined through collaborative analyses of a large number of complex learning situations and through research studies involving experienced and inexperienced design teams. The paper offers a definition and high level description of ACAD and goes on to explain the underlying motivation. The paper also provides an overview of two current areas of development in ACAD: the creation of explicit design rationales and the ACAD toolkit for collaborative design meetings. As well as providing some ideas that can help teachers, design teams and others discuss and agree on their working methods, ACAD has implications for some broader issues in educational technology research and development. It questions some deep assumptions about the framing of research and design thinking, in the hope that fresh ideas may be useful to people involved in leadership and advocacy roles in the field.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Multiple studies have attempted to demonstrate the benefits of augmented reality (AR)-assisted navigation systems in surgery. Lumbosacral transforaminal epidural injection is an effective treatment commonly used in patients with radiculopathy due to spinal degenerative pathologies. However, few studies have applied AR-assisted navigation systems to this procedure. The study aimed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of an AR-assisted navigation system for transforaminal epidural injection.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Through a real-time tracking system and a wireless network to the head-mounted display, computed tomography images of the spine and the path of a spinal needle to the target were visualized on a torso phantom with respiration movements installed. From L1/L2 to L5/S1, needle insertions were performed using an AR-assisted system on the left side of the phantom, and the conventional method was performed on the right side.
RESULTS: The procedure duration was approximately three times shorter, and the number of radiographs required was reduced in the experimental group compared to the control group. The distance from the needle tips to the target areas in the plan showed no significant difference between the two groups. (AR group 1.7 ± 2.3mm, control group 3.2 ± 2.8mm, P value 0.067).
CONCLUSION: An AR-assisted navigation system may be used to reduce the time required for spinal interventions and ensure the safety of patients and physicians in view of radiation exposure. Further studies are essential to apply AR-assisted navigation systems to spine interventions.},

	abstract = {Background: The risk of failing or delaying endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients has commonly been associated with inadequate procedure preparation. Clinicians and trainees in simulation courses for tracheal intubation are encouraged to recall the steps of how to intubate in order to mitigate the risk of a failed intubation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of using optical head mounted display augmented reality (AR) glasses as an assistance tool to perform intubation simulation procedure., Methods: A total of 32 subjects with a mean age of 30±7.8, AR (n1=15) vs non-augmented reality(non-AR) (n2=17). The majority were males (n=22, 68.7\%). Subjects were randomly assigned into two groups: the AR group and the non-AR group. Both groups reviewed a video on how to intubate following the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) intubation guidelines. The AR group had to intubate using the AR glasses head mount display compared to the non-AR where they performed regular intubation., Results: The AR group took longer median (min, max) time (seconds) to ventilate than the non-AR group (280 (130,740) vs 205 (100,390); η2=1.0, p=0.005, respectively). Similarly, there was a higher percent adherence of NEJM intubation checklist (100\% in the AR group vs 82.4\% in the non-AR group; η2=1.8, p{\textless}0.001)., Conclusion: The AR glasses showed promise in assisting different health care professionals on endotracheal intubation simulation. Participants in the AR group took a longer time to ventilate but scored 100\% in the developed checklist that followed the NEJM protocol. This finding shows that the AR technology can be used in a simulation setting and requires further study before clinical use.},

	abstract = {Forensic investigation is a complex procedure involving experts working together to establish cause of death and report findings to legal authorities. While new technologies are being developed to provide better post-mortem imaging capabilities—including mixed-reality (MR) tools to support 3D visualisation of such data—these tools do not integrate seamlessly into their existing collaborative workflow and report authoring process, requiring extra steps, e.g. to extract imagery from the MR tool and combine with physical autopsy findings for inclusion in the report. Therefore, in this work we design and evaluate a new forensic autopsy report generation workflow and present a novel documentation system using hybrid mixed-reality approaches to integrate visualisation, voice and hand interaction, as well as collaboration and procedure recording. Our preliminary findings indicate that this approach has the potential to improve data management, aid reviewability, and thus, achieve more robust standards. Further, it potentially streamlines report generation and minimise dependency on external tools and assistance, reducing autopsy time and related costs. This system also offers significant potential for education. A free copy of this paper and all supplemental materials are available at https://osf.io/ygfzx.},

However, to enable the augmentation of the real environment, there are different types of technology available. While there are constant developments in specific devices, each of these device types provide different premises for collaborative visual data analysis. In our work we combine handheld, optical see-through and video see-through displays to explore and understand the impact of these different device types in collaborative immersive analytics. We conducted a mixed-methods collaborative user study where groups of three performed a shared data analysis task in augmented reality with each user working on a different device, to explore differences in collaborative behaviour, user experience and usage patterns. Both quantitative and qualitative data revealed differences in user experience and usage patterns. For collaboration, the different display types influenced how well participants could participate in the collaborative data analysis, nevertheless, there was no measurable effect in verbal communication.},

	abstract = {To support the nuances of collaborative work, many researchers have been exploring the field of Augmented Reality (AR), aiming to assist in co-located or remote scenarios. Solutions using AR allow taking advantage from seamless integration of virtual objects and real-world objects, thus providing collaborators with a shared understanding or common ground environment. However, most of the research efforts, so far, have been devoted to experiment with technology and mature methods to support its design and development. Therefore, it is now time to understand where the field stands and how well can it address collaborative work with AR, to better characterize and evaluate the collaboration process. In this article, we perform an analysis of the different dimensions that should be taken into account when analysing the contributions of AR to the collaborative work effort. Then, we bring these dimensions forward into a conceptual framework and propose an extended human-centered taxonomy for the categorization of the main features of Collaborative AR. Our goal is to foster harmonization of perspectives for the field, which may help create a common ground for systematization and discussion. We hope to influence and improve how research in this field is reported by providing a structured list of the defining characteristics. Finally, some examples of the use of the taxonomy are presented to show how it can serve to gather information for characterizing AR-supported collaborative work, and illustrate its potential as the grounds to elicit further studies.},

	abstract = {Creativity can be described as the ability to generate new ideas and combine existing ideas in new ways to find novel solutions to problems. Creativity is enhanced by a free flow of knowledge and through social contact. On this basis, the authors argue that knowledge sharing is central to creativity in design and present preliminary evidence to support that view. Design education should therefore include learning and teaching approaches that encourage knowledge sharing. The authors suggest that these approaches should be based on the patterns of knowledge sharing of designers from the creative industries so that students are appropriately prepared for future employment. The paper presents an analysis of the practices of designers in the creative industries in Scotland. The data were gathered through a structured questionnaire distributed to a wide range of companies and from final-year students in design programmes, and the two data sets compared. In practice, employees in the creative industries consume and create knowledge by making use of a variety of distributed resources. Creativity is an important aspect of their practice and all the respondents believed that creativity was enhanced by knowledge sharing collaborative practices. Differences in the practices of students and employees are identified, and the findings are now being used to inform the development of innovative approaches to learning and teaching at Glasgow Caledonian University.},

	abstract = {A great deal of theory and research, not to mention students' and teachers' practical experience, supports the use of group activities in education. Collaborative learning and cooperative learning are two terms commonly used in discussions of how and why to use group activities. This article looks at the issue of whether the two terms--collaborative learning and cooperative learning--are synonymous or whether they represent different conceptualisations of how and why students should interact as part of their learning. Those scholars who differentiate the two terms often see collaborative learning as more student centered and cooperative learning as a more teacher centered way to facilitate student-student interaction. The present article argues that collaborative and cooperative learning should be seen as synonymous student centric approaches, and that teachers and students, regardless of which of the two terms they use, should and will vary the ways they shape their learning environments in order to best facilitate the cognitive and affective benefits that student-student interaction offers.},

Previously validated instruments were used to assess EI, empathic listening and teamwork skills pre- and post-workshop.Findings: While results of the multivariate analysis of variance suggested no difference in study variables before and after the workshop, findings from Pearson’s correlation revealed more pairs of significant correlations post-workshop. Positive association between EI and teamwork skills was found post-workshop.Conclusion: IPE workshops beyond conventional healthcare professions are feasible and welcomed by trainees. EI should be considered an antecedent of teamwork.},

	abstract = {Peer-feedback is a widely-used strategy at the university level for its positive impact on student learning and its multifaceted advantages encompassing social, cognitive, and metacognitive development. However, few studies have assessed its contribution to the development of teamwork skills. This study analyzes students’ perception of how peer-feedback contributes to the development of teamwork skills by comparing the results of two class groups that have taken the same subject, though with different feedback experience designs (face-to-face and mixed feedback vs. non-face-to-face and written feedback, with or without consensus among group members). At the end of the study, 82 participants completed a questionnaire to assess their perception of the peer-feedback experience and its impact on learning and the development of teamwork skills. The findings reveal that students perceive that giving and receiving feedback in face-to-face mixed modality contributes more to developing teamwork skills; however, the presence or absence of consensus among group members to give or receive feedback does not appear to exert a clear impact on the development of these skills. Additionally, the findings suggest that students perceive a greater development of teamwork skills by giving feedback rather than receiving it. These results highlight the importance for teachers to consider such aspects when designing peer-feedback experiences, aiming to maximize the impact on the development of teamwork skills.},

	abstract = {This study conducted a comprehensive tracer analysis of 197 graduates from Daffodil International University’s Marketing bachelor program between 2019 and 2022. The main objective was to evaluate the program's alignment with labor market requirements and its effectiveness in equipping students with the necessary skills to navigate the complexities of the global market. A cross-sectional descriptive design was employed, utilizing a survey questionnaire as the primary data collection instrument. The target population consisted of graduates of the marketing program, selected through purposive sampling to ensure the inclusion of individuals with relevant experience. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to identify trends and percentages. Key findings revealed a significant gender disparity, with more male graduates than female, and high unemployment rates, which highlighted ongoing employment difficulties. While 75.5\% of graduates affirmed the curriculum’s relevance to their professional roles, a gap was noted between the theoretical knowledge imparted and its practical application. The study suggests integrating comprehensive career preparation and extensive networking opportunities into the curriculum to mitigate employment barriers. Additionally, enhancing the curriculum to support entrepreneurial ventures is recommended. The findings emphasize the importance of ongoing curriculum revisions and the development of dynamic career support services to improve graduate employability and adapt to the evolving demands of the marketing profession. This research provides valuable insights for policymakers, curriculum developers, and educational researchers to enhance the relevance of higher education to the workforce, facilitating successful transitions into the labor market.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to measure the potential role of the field of education and the fact of having worked during studies on the employability of the higher educated (ISCED 5-6) cohort targeted by the ET2020 graduates’ employability benchmark. Design/methodology/approach Using the same data source as the benchmark (i.e. the annual LFS microdata from 2004 to 2010), and exploring the additional transition questions collected in the LFS 2009 ad hoc module, the authors define and test four hypotheses using a probit approach on each EU country. Findings The degree plays a significant role in the employability of young graduates across countries and time. In terms of probability of employment, the leading field is health and welfare. In terms of type of contracts, the leading fields are social sciences and engineering. Moreover, what labour markets seem to value the most is the capacity of higher educated students to combine high-level studies and work, i.e. a high workload capacity and intellectual flexibility. Practical implications Reaching the new European target of a minimum of 82 per cent of employment of young graduates will require countries to invest wisely in the most “employable” fields of education. This analysis will help policy makers in their future orientations towards that target. Originality/value The originality of this work lies in its exploration of the exact same extraction of microdata used for the computation of the ET2020 Benchmark indictor and in its immediate political implications for the monitoring of this benchmark.},

	abstract = {Few individuals in the history of education have had greater impact on education policy and practice than Benjamin S. Bloom. During a career that spanned more than 5 decades, his research and writing guided the development of many educational programs and provided insights into the untapped potential of educators to have all students learn well. Bloom's contributions to education began during his years in the Office of the Board of Examiners at the University of Chicago, where he worked from 1940 to 1959. Much of his work at this time focused on the relationships among methods of instruction, educational outcomes, and measurement of those outcomes. This work led to his first book in 1950 and eventually to the work for which he is best known, the "Taxonomy of Educational  Objectives, Handbook I: The Cognitive Domain." In 1959 Bloom spent a year at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University. This year marked a shift in high research and writing, as Bloom began to concentrate on problems in learning, rather than problems in testing, measurement, and evaluation. Bloom's most notable contribution to teaching and learning was his work in developing the theory and practice of mastery learning. Mastery learning was developed as a way for teachers to provide higher quality and more appropriate instruction for their students. Mastery learning depends on feedback, correctives, and enrichments, combined with another essential element of mastery learning, congruence among instructional components. Mastery learning is not an educational  panacea, but careful attention to the essential elements of mastery learning will allow educators at all levels to make great strides toward the goal of all children learning excellently.

	abstract = {Technology in education can influence students to learn actively and can motivate them, leading to an effective process of learning. Previous research has identified the problem that technology will create a passive learning process if the technology used does not promote critical thinking, meaning-making or metacognition. Since its introduction, augmented reality (AR) has been shown to have good potential in making the learning process more active, effective and meaningful. This is because its advanced technology enables users to interact with virtual and real-time applications and brings the natural experiences to the user. In addition, the merging of AR with education has recently attracted research attention because of its ability to allow students to be immersed in realistic experiences. Therefore, this concept paper reviews the research that has been conducted on AR. The review describes the application of AR in a number of fields of learning including Medicine, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Geography, Biology, Astronomy and History. This paper also discusses the advantages of AR compared to traditional technology (such as e-learning and courseware) and traditional teaching methods (chalk and talk and traditional books). The review of the results of the research shows that, overall, AR technologies have a positive potential and advantages that can be adapted in education. The review also indicates the limitations of AR which could be addressed in future research.},

The instructional design combined situated and spiral learning experiences with AR, implemented through a blended learning environment. Data sources included pre- and post-program digital learning student surveys, student and teacher interviews, classroom observations, and AR artifact assessments. Results indicated statistically significant increases with moderate effect sizes in five areas of students’ DL practices: information management; collaboration; communication and sharing; creation; and evaluation and problem-solving. Students did not increase DL in one area: ethics and responsibility. The situated and spiral learning-by-design approach offered increasingly complex AR creation projects in which students developed and transferred their DL. The face-to-face and online learning settings offered multiple ways to collaborate and facilitated the development of students’ DL. The AR technology enabled students to develop DL through designing AR using three types of representation features: multimodal, interactive, and contextual. Practical and theoretical implications for adapting or enhancing this instructional design in future DL programs and for future research are discussed.},

MR displays are defined by means of seven examples of existing display concepts in which real objects and virtual objects are juxtaposed. Essential factors which distinguish different MR display systems from each other are presented, first by means of a table in which the nature of the underlying scene, how it is viewed, and the observer's reference to it are compared, and then by means of a three dimensional taxonomic framework comprising: extent of world knowledge, reproduction fidelity, and extent of presence metaphor. A principal objective of the taxonomy is to clarify terminology issues and to provide a framework for classifying research across different disciplines.},

	abstract = {Augmented reality is a field with a versatile range of applications used in many fields including recreation and education. Continually developing technology spanning the last decade has drastically improved the viability for augmented reality projects now that most of the population possesses a mobile device capable of supporting the graphic rendering systems required for them. Education in particular has benefited from these technological advances as there are now many fields of research branching into how augmented reality can be used in schools. For the purposes of Holocaust education however, there has been remarkable little research into how Augmented Reality can be used to enhance its delivery or impact. The purpose of this study is to speculate regarding the following questions: How is augmented reality currently being used to enhance history education? Does the usage of augmented reality assist in developing long-term memories? Is augmented reality capable of conveying the emotional weight of historical events? Will augmented reality be appropriate for teaching a complex field such as the Holocaust? To address these, multiple studies have been analysed for their research methodologies and how their findings may assist with the development of Holocaust education.},

We consider factors such as publication year, learner type (e.g., K-12, higher education, and adult), technologies in AR, and the advantages and challenges of using AR in educational settings. The full range of SSCI journals was surveyed and a total of 68 research articles were selected for analysis. The findings reveal an increase in the number of AR studies during the last four years. The most reported advantage of AR is that it promotes enhanced learning achievement. Some noted challenges imposed by AR are usability issues and frequent technical problems. We found several other challenges and numerous advantages of AR usage, which are discussed in detail. In addition, current gaps in AR research and needs in the field are identified, and suggestions are offered for future research.},

In this period of time, the total number of academic publications containing “augmented reality” in the Web of Science database, in all indices, was determined as 3540, and among these publications, 58 articles with SSCI index were analyzed within the scope of the research. It analyzes the change of articles related to AR by years; the usage of methods and data collection tools; education field, educational advantages, the type of applications used, technologies, assets used, physical environments in which researches were carried out, sensory types that applications address to, countries and continents in which the articles were published, and the keywords in these articles. Findings obtained were visualized with tables and graphics. According to the results obtained from the findings, there has been a sudden increase in the number of publications since 2013 and it reached the highest level in 2016, the most commonly used method is the mixed method and the data collection tool is questionnaire, most of the studies are carried out in Science, tablets and smartphones are most used, AR applications address to visual sense mostly and such articles are published mostly in the Asian continent. It has been determined that the most positive effect of AR on education is for academic success and learning motivation. It has been understood that the AR is closely related to disciplines such as human-computer interaction, robotics and remote laboratory systems. In addition, some suggestions have been made to researchers and developers based on these research findings.},

It has been found that tangible wireframes are easy to work with and can provide a clearer view of a product's design. To validate this finding, the research focused on the effectiveness of communication through three main aspects of the wireframe: Design, Features, and Layout. These aspects indicate functionality and aesthetic of the website design. The additional outcome implies pros and cons of both tangible and digital wireframes. Research information has been analyzed from data collection of classes activity recorded at an IT faculty. The results showed team communication through wireframe creation depends upon the user experience of team members, understanding of goals, and ability to select tools for digital or tangible wireframe suitable for the design stage. Therefore, this research can guide an instructor of web development by choosing the right tools and techniques appropriate for learners-those without and with experience.

This article conceptually develops and empirically analyzes users’ perceived digital overuse (PDO) as a widespread social phenomenon sensitive to existing inequalities. In an age of digital communication abundance and closing Internet access divides, overuse has not been systematically investigated nor are its social disparities known. In a first step, PDO is demarcated from Internet addiction, theoretically defined, and operationalized. Then, the prevalence of perceived overuse is assessed in a representative population sample of Italian Internet users ( N = 2,008) and predictors of digital overuse are tested. Results show that digital communication use and the level of social pressure to function digitally are positively related to PDO. Education is negatively associated with PDO and positively with digital communication use and social digital pressure. Overuse is emerging as a new dimension of digital inequality with implications for theory and future research in digital well-being.},

This article critiques three of the researcher’s mlearning projects that can be classed as ‘‘failures’’ and compares them to successful projects to draw out critical implications for mlearning project design and implementation to avoid common pitfalls leading to potential project failure. This article uses the researcher’s six critical success factors identified across the 35 mlearning projects to evaluate these three projects, and concludes that projects resulting in ‘‘no significant difference’’ in pedagogical outcomes are the result of attempts to shoehorn old pedagogies into new technologies.

	abstract = {Purpose This article presents findings on the relationship between social interactions in remote learning environments and the perceived effectiveness of remote learning. Specifically, it examines the impact of teacher-student interactions and student-student interactions on perceived effectiveness of remote learning, with a focus on how students’ attitudes towards remote education mediate this relationship. Additionally, it explores the moderating effects of cultural context and study form (full-time vs part-time) on these dynamics. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research design was used, employing a structured survey questionnaire to collect data from a diverse group of students from Poland, India, Indonesia and the UK. The study involved 1,883 students and analysed the data using statistical methods to assess both mediation and moderation effects. The study employed data obtained from a survey of universities in four countries conducted between 2021 and 2022. Findings The results emphasise the significant influence of both teacher-student and student-student interactions on students’ perceptions of the effectiveness of remote learning. Positive attitudes towards remote learning were found to mediate this relationship, amplifying the beneficial effects of social interaction. Furthermore, the study reveals that cultural context and study form moderate these relationships, with varying impacts observed across different cultural backgrounds and study arrangements. The study has implications for theory, research, policy implementation and practice in improving education programs. Research limitations/implications The comparative analysis included only four countries, which may have affected the overall representativeness of the results. Because the study is limited to students from Poland, India, Indonesia and the UK, the findings may not fully capture the diversity of remote learning experiences across other cultural and socioeconomic contexts. As a result, there may be challenges in generalising these findings to all higher education settings globally. Future research is recommended to include a more extensive sample from additional countries and regions to validate the current results and enhance their generalisability. Therefore, it is worth continuing research in this area, considering more countries and potential moderating factors. Originality/value This research contributes original insights into the dynamics of remote learning during a global crisis, offering an understanding of how social interactions, student attitudes and contextual factors shape perceived effectiveness. These findings provide critical guidance for educators, policymakers and institutions seeking to optimise remote education strategies in diverse cultural and educational settings.},

	abstract = {Purpose The digitalization of society results in challenges and opportunities for learning and education. This paper describes exemplary transformations from current to future practices. It illustrates multi-dimensional aspects of learning which complement and transcend current frameworks of learning focused on schools. While digital technologies are necessary for these transformations, they are not sufficient. The paper briefly illustrates the applicability of the conceptual framework to the COVID-19 pandemic. It concludes that design opportunities and design trade-offs in relation to digital technologies and learning should be explored by envisioning the cultural transformation that are desirable for making learning a part of life. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on the work conducted at the symposium “Rethinking and Reinventing Learning, Education, and Collaboration in the Digital Age—From Creating Technologies to Transforming Cultures” that took place in Engeltofta outside of Gävle, Sweden in September 2019. The symposium invited scholars in collaborative analysis of design opportunities and design trade-offs in relation to digital technologies and learning and explored design strategies for systematically and proactively increasing digital technology's contributions to learning and collaborating. The paper first provides a condensed introduction of a conceptual framework summarizing current practices, their problems and promising alternatives. Multi-dimensional aspects of learning and lifelong learning will be briefly described as promising future alternatives to school learning. Examples of transformative practices are supporting the major argument of the paper that creating new technologies is an important prerequisite to address the fundamental challenge of transforming cultures. The unanticipated but fundamental event of the occurrence of COVID-19 will be briefly described to provide further evidence for the need and the applicability of our conceptual framework for rethinking and reinventing learning, education and collaboration in the digital age. Findings The paper provides a condensed introduction of a conceptual framework summarizing current practices, their problems and promising alternatives. The framework includes multi-dimensional aspects of learning and lifelong learning as a promising future alternative to a focus on school learning.

	abstract = {As we have seen in the previous chapter, students see their smartphones as absolutely essential for their social, recreational and personal lives and continue to use them in school or university settings. In this sense, teachers and instructors can try to use the mobile devices with students as bridge for a “seamless learning” between formal and informal contexts, so it is possible to increase students’ motivation to learn. Many teachers can struggle to conceive of approaches that differ from traditional practices, and thus replicate methods centred on the formal, physical classroom environment so they will need training not only in order to acquire technological skills in using specific software and apps, but above all in order to build the pedagogical and methodological competencies required to design integrated and effective learning environments. To do so, many frameworks and methods are available and are based on learning theories that differ from the traditional models and it is difficult to say which theory will best underpin any given mobile learning activity. Anyhow, it may be useful to adopt theories with the highest degree of involvement such as situated cognition and experiential learning in such way that curricular knowledge can be socially constructed.},

	abstract = {Learning in humans is highly embedded in social interaction: since the very early stages of our lives, we form memories and acquire knowledge about the world from and with others. Yet, within cognitive science and neuroscience, human learning is mainly studied in isolation. The focus of past research in learning has been either exclusively on the learner or (less often) on the teacher, with the primary aim of determining developmental trajectories and/or effective teaching techniques. In fact, social interaction has rarely been explicitly taken as a variable of interest, despite being the medium through which learning occurs, especially in development, but also in adulthood. Here, we review behavioural and neuroimaging research on social human learning, specifically focusing on cognitive models of how we acquire semantic knowledge from and with others, and include both developmental as well as adult work. We then identify potential cognitive mechanisms that support social learning, and their neural correlates. The aim is to outline key new directions for experiments investigating how knowledge is acquired in its ecological niche, i.e. socially, within the framework of the two-person neuroscience approach.

This study aims to investigate the importance of social interaction on the effectiveness of online learning during the pandemic when social distancing norms are in place. Design/methodology/approach This study uses the partial least square (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM) approach, a nonparametric method based on total variance, using the SmartPLS software 3.0. The data were collected using the snowball sampling technique from the students who were learning online due to the pandemic COVID-19 and asked them to forward the survey link in their network. Findings The results suggested that social interaction has a positive significant impact on the effectiveness of online learning. However, this effect is reduced in the presence of social distance norms as people give more importance to continuous learning and to saving lives rather than socializing in the online environment. Originality/value The study will be helpful for instructors and educational institutes to formalize the strategies to enhance social interaction in online learning and analyze their pedagogy to improve effectiveness.},

Emerging technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR) can transform education by making challenging concepts visible and accessible to novices. We present a Hololens-based augmented reality system where collaborators learn about the invisible electromagnetism phenomena involved in audio speakers, and we measure the benefits of AR technology through quantitative and qualitative methods. Specifically, we measure learning (knowledge gains and transfer) and collaborative knowledge exchange behaviors. Our results indicate that, while AR generally provides a novelty effect, specific educational AR visualizations can be both beneficial and detrimental to learning – they helped students to learn spatial content and structural relationships, but hindered their understanding of kinesthetic content. Furthermore, AR facilitated learning in collaborations by providing representational common ground, which improved communication and peer teaching. We discuss these effects, as well as identify factors that have positive impact (e.g., co-located representations, easier access to resources, better grounding) or negative impact (e.g., tunnel vision, overlooking kinesthetic feedback) on student collaborative learning with augmented reality applications.},

The decompressive craniotomy procedure stands out as particularly complex and time-sensitive. The current teleconsultation approach relies on 2D color cameras, often offering only a fixed view and limited visual capabilities between experts and surgeons. However, teleconsultation can be addressed with Mixed Reality and immersive technology to potentially enable a better consultation of the procedure. We conducted an extensive user study focusing on decompressive craniotomy to investigate the advantages and challenges of our 3D teleconsultation system compared to a 2D video-based consultation system. Our 3D teleconsultation system leverages real-time 3D reconstruction of the patient and environment to empower experts to provide guidance and create virtual 3D annotations. The study utilized 3D-printed head models to perform a lifelike surgical intervention. It involved 14 medical residents and demonstrated an in-vitro 17\% improvement in accurately describing the incision size on the patient’s head, contributing to potentially improved patient outcomes.},

The proposed processing pipeline uses fully digital stereoscopic imaging devices, which support multispectral and white light imaging to generate high resolution image data, and consists of five modules. Input/output data handling, a hybrid multimodal image analysis and a bi-directional interactive augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) interface for local and remote surgical assistance are of high relevance for the complete framework. The hybrid multimodal 3D scene analysis module uses different wavelengths to classify tissue structures and combines this spectral data with metric 3D information. Additionally, we propose a zoom-independent intraoperative tool for virtual ossicular prosthesis insertion (e.g. stapedectomy) guaranteeing very high metric accuracy in sub-millimeter range (1/10 mm). A bi-directional interactive AR/MR communication module guarantees low latency, while consisting surgical information and avoiding informational overload. Display agnostic AR/MR visualization can show our analyzed data synchronized inside the digital binocular, the 3D display or any connected head-mounted-display (HMD). In addition, the analyzed data can be enriched with annotations by involving external clinical experts using AR/MR and furthermore an accurate registration of preoperative data. The benefits of such a collaborative surgical system are manifold and will lead to a highly improved patient outcome through an easier tissue classification and reduced surgery risk.},

Over the past ten years, assessment offices and teaching and learning centers have compiled lists of measurable verbs aligned with the six categories that comprise Bloom’s taxonomy. The author analyzed 30 compilations posted on web sites and evaluated how well these verbs aligned with categories in Bloom’s taxonomy. The author discusses the value of Bloom’s taxonomy as a heuristic for writing student learning outcomes and other factors faculty should consider when they articulate learning outcomes to describe levels of expertise attained by students who complete an associate’s, bachelor’s, or graduate degree.},

	abstract = {Technologically enhanced learning has shifted from digital resources to smart components to afford more content, support tools, and provide learning guidance that meets a learner's needs and interests by delivering smart university services. Smart interaction is essential in smart university, it is a concept that offers new opportunities and new channels of communication between learners. This communication is reinforced by the concept of collaboration, an important factor for knowledge sharing. The current study concerns team building based on the recommendation of the most appropriate collaborator in order to make groups of learners promoting universal participation of all members of the team. The complexity of this problem requires collaborative filtering algorithms to find the potential collaborators for each learner, taking into account problem-solving as a parameter representing items of the recommendation matrix.},

	abstract = {Past research suggests that power asymmetry within teams can have a stifling effect on team learning and performance. We argue here that this effect is contingent on whether power advantages within a team are used to advance individual or collective interests. This study considers the moderating role of one factor that can influence the individual or collective orientation of team members—the type of performance feedback that a team receives. We propose that whereas individual feedback reinforces the negative effects of power asymmetry on team learning, group feedback fosters a collective orientation within a team that transforms power differences into a stimulus for team learning. Analysis of multisource, multimethod data obtained from 218 individuals in 46 teams provided support for these hypotheses. Results also suggested that team learning mediated the relationship between power asymmetry and team performance. These findings suggest that power asymmetry can be a resource for and not just an obstacle to team learning in power-asymmetric teams.},

In this paper we present the findings of our efforts to use collaborative work as a mediation tool in order to achieve more inclusive learning settings. This work starts from the assumption that learning should be seen as a communicative process. This builds on the ideas of Vygotsky, who stressed the importance of social interactions in the development of complex functions and of working in the zone of proximal development in order to promote children’s development. The study used a critical and ethnographic approach and thus peer interactions were implemented as a daily practice. Data were collected through participant observation (audio and videotaped), questionnaires, tasks inspired in projective techniques, interviews, reports, and sets of materials gathered by the teachers. The findings illuminate the role of collaboration in facilitating more positive attitudes towards academic learning and mathematics, promoting students’ socialisation, their socio-cognitive and affective development, and their school achievement.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the proliferation of online learning platforms has transformed the landscape of education, offering unprecedented opportunities for access and flexibility. However, as online learning continues to evolve, ensuring inclusivity and fostering collaboration within virtual communities remains a critical challenge. This review explores strategies aimed at promoting inclusivity and collaboration in online education settings. Firstly, it delves into the significance of creating a supportive online learning environment conducive to diversity. This involves implementing inclusive practices such as accessible course materials, accommodating diverse learning styles, and fostering a culture of respect and empathy among participants. Additionally, leveraging technology to facilitate real-time communication and interaction among learners from diverse backgrounds enhances inclusivity by breaking down geographical and cultural barriers. Secondly, the review examines the pivotal role of community engagement in fostering collaboration and mutual support among online learners. Establishing virtual communities where participants can engage in meaningful discussions, share resources, and collaborate on projects cultivates a sense of belonging and collective ownership of the learning process. Moreover, integrating collaborative learning activities such as group projects and peer reviews promotes active engagement and facilitates the exchange of diverse perspectives. Furthermore, the review highlights the importance of instructor involvement in fostering inclusive and collaborative online learning environments. Educators play a crucial role in designing inclusive curriculum, facilitating meaningful discussions, and providing constructive feedback that acknowledges diverse perspectives. Moreover, equipping instructors with training and resources to effectively manage online communities fosters a supportive learning environment conducive to collaboration and inclusivity. Promoting inclusivity and collaboration in online learning requires a multifaceted approach encompassing inclusive design, community engagement, and instructor support. By implementing these strategies, educators can create enriching online learning experiences that empower learners from diverse backgrounds to thrive and succeed.},

In this article, I review a diverse set of literatures that directly address proactive behavior in organizational contexts. I describe four constructs related to proactive behavior: proactive personality, personal initiative, role breadth self-efficacy, and taking charge. Next, I review six research domains that have explicitly addressed proactive behaviors: socialization, feedback seeking, issue selling, innovation, career management, and certain kinds of stress management. After considering findings from these research streams, I offer an analysis of the different approaches to the study of proactive behavior and provide a set of suggestions for future research.},

	abstract = {"On Collaboration: Personal, Educational and Societal Arenas provides an elaborated analysis of what it means to collaborate, particularly in educational contexts. It thereby adopts a mixed-genre approach, following L. Vygotsky, who maintained that, for example, the works of Shakespeare and of Dostoyevsky had as much to teach us about the human psyche as laboratory studies and field observations. The authors draw on results of scientific research, particularly on collaborative learning and work, as well as on autobiographical narrative and analysis of works of art. In addition, they broaden the scientific perspective on collaboration from purely educational perspectives by including personal, artistic, and societal contexts. By exploiting benefits of different styles and genres (expository, narrative, fictional, argumentative) this text intends to lead readers towards further reflection on collaboration in their own lives, and towards deeper understanding of the complexity and misconceptions of collaboration, including its societal relevance"--},

Considering management students as the talent pool of future managers, it is important to prepare them to be successful in a team environment. This study suggests that individual-level variables are important in understanding how students react in classroom team situations. Self-efficacy, the self-belief in one's ability to perform a specific task, is a valid predictor of performance and can be helpful in understanding how students work in a team environment. The current study reveals that overall team performance moderates the relationship between self-efficacy of working in teams and the outcome variables, individual satisfaction and individual performance. Self-efficacy significantly predicted individual performance and individual satisfaction in low-performing teams, but not in high-performing teams. Implications of these findings are discussed as they relate to using teams in the classroom and modern organizations. Future research is also proposed.},

While positivist and interpretive philosophies are the two most popular research philosophies across diverse research fields, critical realism offers a third alternative. Critical realism is a research philosophy that assumes the existence of an independent reality but also accepts that there may be varied interpretations of it due to a difference in context. Mechanisms are the theoretical building blocks of critical realism, and presence, absence, or interaction of certain mechanisms may result in the presence or absence of certain events. However, limited guidelines are available on conducting a critical realist case study. This chapter fills this gap by providing some practical guidelines on how a CR-based case study may be planned and executed. Practical guidelines are offered for framing the research question, data collection, writing a narrative, coding, and explanation building aligned with a critical realist philosophy.},

Among the newer skill based areas of study that is greatly in demand is professional sales. In this paper, two courses in a successful professional sales program are examined through the lenses of experiential learning theory and Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives. Experiential learning theory posits that cycles of experience and reflection can create greater levels of understanding and skills. Bloom's taxonomy provides a sequence of increasingly comprehensive and complex levels of learning. These two frameworks are conceptually combined to show how experiential learning cycles can incrementally move students to higher levels of learning. The exercises and activities in the professional sales courses support and illustrate this important concept and show how tangible, marketable skills can be developed in a classroom setting.},

The sample of the study included 91 seventh graders from a province in the north of Turkey. A quasi-experimental design with two experimental groups and a control group was utilized. Based upon marker-based AR technologies, FenAR software was developed to support with PBL activities in the classroom. The experimental results indicated that integrating AR into PBL activities both increased students' learning achievement and promoted their positive attitudes towards physics subjects. This technology contributed to students' long-term retention of the concepts in the field of physics. In semi-structured interviews, the students emphasized that AR applications were more useful, realistic, and interesting for their learning; helped them to understand and analyse the problem scenarios. Apart from educational advantages, AR applications may lead to physical disorders among some of the students. It has been suggested that AR technology can be a potential and effective tool for activating students' positive emotions in PBL process. Moreover, implications on use of AR for physics education and recommendations for further studies are also discussed in the study.},

This negatively affects the quality of their everyday social life. Children with ASD can learn to socially interact with virtual three-dimensional (3D) characters in animated games enhanced with augmented reality (AR). They can learn about body language and facial expressions through roleplay. This teaching method can effectively improve the interactive social skills of children with ASD and reduce the fear and anxiety which they typically experience when they face real people. However, most current virtual roleplay models focus only on predefined body language and facial expressions limited by the training system. These systems lack immediacy and a sense of genuine interaction for children with ASD. Therefore, we wanted to create a system that will allow trainers and therapists to control 3D virtual characters that are able to produce in real time the full range of natural body language and facial expressions appropriate for males, females, and even special cartoon characters. Based on the multiple baseline design across subjects, the data indicated that real-time Kinect Skeletal Tracking (KST) System can help the children with ASD improved their social interaction.},

They involve a comprehensive search to locate all relevant published and unpublished work on a subject; a systematic integration of search results; and a critique of the extent, nature, and quality of evidence in relation to a particular research question. The best reviews synthesize studies to draw broad theoretical conclusions about what a literature means, linking theory to evidence and evidence to theory. This guide describes how to plan, conduct, organize, and present a systematic review of quantitative (meta-analysis) or qualitative (narrative review, meta-synthesis) information. We outline core standards and principles and describe commonly encountered problems. Although this guide targets psychological scientists, its high level of abstraction makes it potentially relevant to any subject area or discipline. We argue that systematic reviews are a key methodology for clarifying whether and how research findings replicate and for explaining possible inconsistencies, and we call for researchers to conduct systematic reviews to help elucidate whether there is a replication crisis.},

	abstract = {In this study, whether using Augment Reality (AR)-based learning materials could benefit high school students in the process of Chinese writing was explored, along with the pros and cons of using AR for acquiring Chinese writing skills. In order to reduce the gap between the designers and practitioner teachers, Chinese instructors were invited to co-design the AR-based writing materials to achieve the integration of learners, teachers and educational system technology developers in a collaborative process. The AR-based writing support system was provided to a total of 30 twelfth-grade students who participated in the experiment. The students in the experimental group participated in the writing activity using both AR-based learning material and paper-based supports, while the control group worked with only paper-based writing support materials. The results revealed that the AR techniques helped the intermediate-level students the most in their writing performance of content control, article structure and wording. The students, especially the low-achievers, reflected that the functions of the AR system supported them to start writing the first paragraph more quickly, and enriched their ideas. A possible mode for integrating AR techniques in writing courses is proposed. This paper could serve as a reference for educators and learning technology researchers who wish to design AR-guided writing learning materials or courses with the goal of encouraging learners to experience the writing process in a variety of settings.},

The pedagogy for teamwork instruction in the classroom may not simulate real workplace events or parallel organizational behavior in order to attain a successful outcome. In universities, teamwork often breeds frustration and dysfunction, since the teams often do not perform at a high level or reach their full potential. This paper will provide best practices for creating productive teams in the classroom in preparation for the workforce.

	abstract = {In the digital era, technology plays an important role in the creation and exchange of knowledge and information in the field of education. When technology is applied in educational settings, it may increase teacher knowledge and support students’ learning and motivation. Over the last decade, social networking (including its integration with online games and educational content) has been introduced in classrooms to support teaching (Johnson \&amp; Germain-Froese, 2016). Many of these tools are free and easy for teachers to use to create learning content. However, these tools may not have an educational value in and of themselves. They only become important when teachers use them as part of the learning and teaching process. The decision about whether to use technology in the classroom often depends on the perceptions of each teacher. This study, therefore, investigated how teachers in secondary schools use technology in their classrooms and their perceptions of the use of technology. The participants in this study were 126 Thai secondary teachers supported by the Ministry of Education’s Secondary Educational Service Area Office 33 (Surin Province). These teachers were language teachers from 58 secondary schools in 17 districts of Surin, Thailand. They were asked to complete questionnaires to report on their use and perceptions of technology use in the classroom. The findings revealed that most of the teachers had knowledge of technological tools and had integrated technologies in their classes. Certain types of tools were already used by all the teachers, while networked educational technology tools were only being integrated in some classrooms. The findings also revealed factors affecting the use and non-use of technology. On the basis of these findings, pedagogical implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging technology that is being used in a wide range of fields such as medicine, gaming, psychology and sociology. The use of VR is promising in the field of education and requires investigation, but research on the use of VR in education is still limited. This enables the exploration of new territories, and design education is one of them. Design education, an important part of the curriculum of architecture students who aim to conceptualize problem-solving, is still taught using traditional methodologies with touches of digital technologies. Thus, there is limited research into the implementation of VR. This study proposes using VR in basic design education and focuses on the usability of VR, especially for problem-solving activities. It presents the literature on basic design education of digital approaches, VR technologies, usability criteria and the technology acceptance model. In order to analyse the usability of VR, we conducted an experimental study with 20 first-year interior architecture and architecture students. We found that, statistically, there is a significant difference in terms of ‘the intention to use’ and ‘the perceived enjoyment’ between the VR group and the paper-based group. Moreover, there is, statistically, a difference in effectiveness within the paper-based group and the VR-based group when one compares the success of two types of design problems in the same group. Thus, one can summarize that using VR can strongly enhance problem-solving activities in interior architecture and for architecture students and that one can consider it to be a promising and complementary tool in basic design education.},

In this paper, it is presented a new approach for software architecture design, which uses a Transpiler (Haxe) as a programming language and as a generator of the business logic and service layer. The goal is that software developers write the business logic only once and transpile it to equivalent server layers for C\#, Java, and PHP, making them reusable and runnable on several platforms. An experimental prototype was developed to test the idea (published on GitHub with the codename “Cornerstone”), that implements a benchmark to compare when running on different Operating Systems and Application Servers combinations. A single web interface is developed, using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and XML-HttpRequest, which connect to any of the transpiled services regardless of the deployment platform. Cloud instances were used to assure comparability. Preliminary results were obtained and analyzed to show the concept validity and which platform combination provided the highest performance.},

In essence, we are searching for a 3-D user interface metaphor as powerful as the desktop metaphor for 2-D. At the heart of the Studierstube system, collaborative augmented reality is used to embed computer-generated images into the real work environment. In the first part of this paper, we review the user interface of the initial Studierstube system, in particular the implementation of collaborative augmented reality, and the Personal Interaction Panel, a two-handed interface for interaction with the system. In the second part, an extended Studierstube system based on a heterogeneous distributed architecture is presented. This system allows the user to combine multiple approaches— augmented reality, projection displays, and ubiquitous computing—to the interface as needed. The environment is controlled by the Personal Interaction Panel, a twohanded, pen-and-pad interface that has versatile uses for interacting with the virtual environment. Studierstube also borrows elements from the desktop, such as multitasking and multi-windowing. The resulting software architecture is a user interface management system for complex augmented reality applications. The presentation is complemented by selected application examples.},

	abstract = {The use of interdisciplinary teams to address human service delivery issues is becoming increasingly common. Complicated problems require the expertise of a variety of specialists from different disciplines, and increased specialization brings with it a heightened needfor interdisciplinary collaboration. While team meetings are expected to serve as the vehicle for successful collaboration among professionals, three barriers often stand in the way of effective team interactions: disorganization, misunderstandings, and problem-solving difficulties. These problems suggest a need for interventions aimed at improving team communication and decision-making processes, as well as a need for methods to observe and evaluate the effects of such interventions on a team's functioning. The purpose of this research was twofold: First, we sought to investigate the effects of an intervention that differentially targeted and trained three sets of group communication and decision-making skills aimed at addressing the three barriers mentioned above. A second goal was to develop new methods of observation that would overcome several serious limitations which have characterized the bulk of existing team intervention research. An interdisciplinary rehabilitation clinic's staff served as the subject of the study. Using a multiple baseline design across categories of behaviors, the effects of a three-part intervention on the team's day-to-day meeting behavior was assessed. While there was substantial variability and overlap in much of the data, videotaped observations revealed that following each training session, there were modest increases in the average frequency of use of most targeted behaviors. Social validation data indicated that team members found the training to be both useful and enjoyable. Implications forfuture research are discussed.},

Teamwork promotes communication among members; application exercises promote active learning. Students must prepare for each class; failure to do so harms their team’s performance. Therefore, TBL promotes accountability. As part of the course grade, students assess the performance of their teammates. The evaluation forces students to rank their teammates and to provide rationale for the highest and lowest rankings. These evaluations provide rich data on small-group dynamics. In this paper, we analyze 211 student teammate assessments. We find evidence that teams consistently give the lowest evaluations to their least involved members, suggesting that the team component increases accountability, which can promote learning. From these findings we draw implications about small-group dynamics in general and the pedagogy of TBL in particular.},

            Using European Company Survey data, this article explores the relationship between trust and establishment performance under works councils, on the one hand, and union bodies on the other. Trust is initially measured using the individual survey respondent's assessment of the ‘contribution’ of the other side. Although the rating of the employee representative is favoured over that of management as less subject to feedback from performance, the potential endogeneity of employee trust in management is also modelled. Next, a preferred inverse measure of trust (or dissonance) is constructed from the discrepancy between the assessments of the two sides of the quality of workplace industrial relations. Employee trust is associated throughout with improved establishment performance, and conversely for the dissonance counterpart. In their presence, neither type of workplace representation is superior to the other.},

	abstract = {Among the requirements for engineering programs, the Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET) criteria for student outcomes require students to have the ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences, recognize ethical and professional responsibilities, function effectively on a team, and apply new knowledge. A review of literature for skills comprised within these ABET criteria determined 26 topics necessary for the entry-level and continued success of engineers. Nearly 500 companies and organizations rated the importance and proficiency of their recent entry-level engineers for these 26 identified soft (professional) skills. The findings suggest that although entry-level engineers have proficiency in all of these ABET required skills, the entry-level engineers were not meeting the level of importance expressed by the organization for 24 of these 26 skills. A specific ABET required skill, the ability to communicate effectively with diverse groups of people, has the greatest difference between the level of proficiency and the level of importance. Analysis of variance was conducted using each of the demographic variables to determine the effect sizes in the ratings of importance, proficiency, and the differences between importance and proficiency. These results were shared with industry members to confirm the relevance of the survey findings during the pandemic. This survey research has implications for any university engineering department where students are seeking entry-level engineering positions after graduation.},

	abstract = {This study aims to bridge the gap between extended reality (XR) and digital literacy (DL) in popular science education and further develop a DL–XR framework. XR includes augmented, virtual, and mixed reality (AR, VR, and MR), which has received increased attention and has been used for educational purposes in recent years. However, the studies of XR in popular science education and its impact on students are scant. It is also challenging to find studies entailing XR and DL in education. This study not only offers an overview of the status quo of XR education but also is the first research presenting a referential framework that systematically integrates the many dimensions of XR and DL for future research and educational practices. XR has been extensively used in museums, benefiting users with immersive, authentic, hands-on, and interactive experiences. In the DL–XR framework, based on the variations of “individual-group” and “passive consumption-active creation”, eight dimensions of DL linked to XR are proposed, including “access and understanding”, “evaluation”, “ethics and well-being”, “interaction”, “collaboration”, “creation”, “problem-solving”, and “civic engagement and responsibility”. In the nurturing of DL, evidence revealed that XR is mostly used for learners to access knowledge/information and interact with virtual items; nonetheless, its applications for active creation, problem-solving, and collaboration are seldom prioritised. This study further proposes integrating project-based learning into XR pedagogical practices, which can maximise its impact on learning and empower the learners to achieve advanced levels of DL.},

	abstract = {This is a research report of teaching patterns of critical thinking using the competency-based 3CA (an acronym for the educational practices of Concept maps, Critical thinking, Collaboration, and Assessment) model of classroom instruction to change the grammar of schooling. Critical thinking is defined as the “WH questions”: “what, when, where, how, who, and why” taken from Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics. These questions are threaded through the practices of concept maps, collaboration, and assessment. This conceptualization of patterns of thinking is influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein’s conceptualization of the relations between the language games of practice and language games in the mind. This study compares individual and collaborative approaches to teaching the critical thinking “WH questions” in a child development class. Students in the individual groups used more “what questions,” whereas students in the collaborative group used more “why and how questions.”},

	abstract = {The first attempts to create devices that allow interacting with the imitated reality, as well as augmenting reality with superimposed information, were made at the beginning of the 20th century, the very concept of mixed reality (the “reality-virtuality continuum”), which elements are virtual (VR) and augmented (AR) reality, is quite young (24 years), as well as the market of these technologies. The concept of virtual and augmented reality hasn’t changed radically in the past 30 years, but VR and AR devices and software, and content have gone through a significant evolutionary path, and have already experienced several growth spikes.VR and AR technologies can be applied not only in entertainment and games. Many experts believe that virtual and augmented reality, along with Big Data, cloud technologies, artificial intelligence and some others, will become the key technologies of the 4th industrial revolution. VR and AR also have the potential to become the next big computing platform. Today VR and AR technologies help not only to create conceptually new markets, but also to disrupt existing ones.This article discusses the evolution of the VR and AR concepts and technologies and current market trends. The results of the survey show the key obstacles for the mass distribution of AR and VR technologies: high implementation and operational costs of AR/VR solutions; lack of high-quality content and imperfect devices, implicit effectiveness of their use.Based on the empirical study, a rather extensive list of benefits from using virtual and augmented reality technologies has been drawn up: faster and cheaper learning, training and guiding processes, increase in their efficiency, the reduction of the costs of elements and supplies needed, training support personnel; reducing potential risks to life and health of employees and other people while special training (medical operations and invasive procedures, evacuation, security, rescue in various emergencies) and the related optimization of the compensations; reducing the number of errors and accelerating the processes of assembling, repairing and operating special equipment, searching for information, necessary details, product location in the warehouse; significant reduction of accidents rate, as well as the exploration costs, due to the early identification of malfunctions; accelerating the pace of the designing and prototyping objects, significantly reducing the cost and duration of physical modeling process; improving customer experience, product and trading platforms design, that leads to corresponding increase in volume of sales; improving (simplifying) of communication and increasing its effectiveness.},

Although educators are encouraged to integrate technology in training to better equip the learner in navigating the continuously evolving digital workspace, how this is done is less clear. The purpose of this chapter is to share an inclusive method of how educational systems can digitize constructivism with 21st century skills to ensure all students are prepared for the global workforce.},
